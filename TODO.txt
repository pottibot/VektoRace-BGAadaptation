// TODAY'S(?) MENU //
+ recalculate turn position
+ tokens in log
+ rid of useless js methods (move car)
+ some comments around the code would be nice
+ fix collision algo and adapt to vector

-----------------------------------------------------------

VEKTORACE INTERFACE CODE CLEANUP SERVICE:
- get rid of dojo (KINDA)
- Rotation as a css Class (MHH)
- OnEnteringState calling func
- create all game elements statically (???)
- get rid of useless methods

GAMEPLAY PLEASE PROGRESS:
- current gear display on hover car (dicelike)
- illegal placement detection (maybe display illegal moves with red X)

GAME LOGIC CAVIATS:
- client server move validation for first positioning too

JS PRECISION:
- make so that interface can always recover from bad ajaxcall (ie: wait until callback before applying modifications. or make error callback reset those modifications)

CSSEX:
- clean sprite positioning by adding 1 px to every movement (es: 0-500, 501-1000, ...)
  (DOES IT REALLY WORK LIKE THAT?)

SCARY STUFF:
- attack maneuvers
- pit stop

BORING STUFF:
- statistics
- game progression

BEAUTY SALOON:
- game elements (clip-path) shadows
- track map
- html tokens in notification log
