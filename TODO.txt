IMMEDIATE TODOS:
- 

WEEK TODO:
- [v] adjust pitwall size (-> use regular vector and scale all vertices during collision detection [REQUIRES A CLEANUP OF OCTAGON CLASS AND SAT ALGO])
- [v] implement progression by curve
- implement game end condition -> IMPLEMENT GAME OPTIONS AND VARIANTS
- [v] fix zoom scroll
- attack maneuver visuals redo
- [v] boost server validity check should specify when no positions are available
- [v] adjust start positioning area to new pitwall size
- [v] handle boost phase when passing curves from behind
- [v] handle prevent tire position after emergency brake from interface -> SEND ADDITIONAL DATA TO CLIENT
- [v] handle car rotation preview on emergency brake phase
- [v] brake notifications
- [v] new turn order algo based also on curve and lap progression

GAMEPLAY DEVELOPMENT:
- pit stop

GENERAL:
- some comments around the code would be nice
- maybe php states hold data until jump so no need to recalc args on user action
- some elements could be kept active on user input, server will handle move validity. maybe better for user understanding

BUGS:
- gear vector not being destroyed after animation end (happens only if browser is not active)
- negative orientations are not handled well and should be avoided when updating the DB
- isBehind() algo sometimes is wrong with close proximity to boundry
- PITWALL IS ACTUALLY SMALLER THAN A VECTOR?? (3/4 of it, to be precise) fixing this will be boring and may brake some stuff
- error where some code assumes that getAdjacentOctagons() returns in clockwise order when it in fact doesn't. corrected it where i could but there might still be a few bugs around

BONUS STUFF:
- add flying start octagon preview (+ animation)
- game elements (clip-path) shadows
- track map
- icons in log
- current gear display on hover car (dicelike)
- endgame replay
- wider first positioning area

GAME INTERFACE:
- add global zoom robustness to scaling and scrolling methods
- adjust scroll to interface scaling
- be sure that interface is robust to page zoom
- add touch controls for hovering events
- tooltips everywhere

GAME LOGIC:
- code for handling octagon isCar / isCurve can be made prettier
- code for SAT overlapping between intervals can also be made prettier
- get gamestate args from state object instead of recalc
- many clienttranslate missing
- give extra time to players

GAME DATA, STATISTICS AND OPTION:
- map variants
- statistics
- scroll to new events option
