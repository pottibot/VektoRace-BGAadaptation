CURRENT TODO (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE):
- animations support instantaneus mode? make anim insta when brower window not active
  -> watchout for callback, they won't run if anim time is 0 (instantaneus), (eg. car is already on destination, in normal conditions)
- [v] new map adaptation
- [t] visual reminders of penalities and modifiers
- [t] statistics
- check all translations
- [v] new curves
- [t] new offtrack detection system
- offtrack penality
- touch integration
- [t] give time to players
- [t] implement getGameProgression()
- implement zombieTurn() and player leaving
- [v] place car phase:
  - [v] reset move
  - [v] handle midway exceptions (do nothing, server will handle, click on reset on exceptions. - EH, not pretty)
        -> in the end client will do the basic checks, code note pretty but that's the best way to go without restructuring the whole state
- tooltips
- [v] test fewer than 3 players
- [t] add 6 players limit
- test spectator
- interface is robust to page zoom ?
- test browsers

BUG and FIXES:
- [t] shunt hit produces boxbox marker?
- [???] broken new turn order algo? (DOESN'T SEEM SO, maybe close calls are not handled properly -> if on the same line, car does not overtake)
- [???] tire octagon showed before than invalid octagon?
- [???] attack move show inactive before invalid 
- [t] automatic display gear selection dialog window broken
- box box called only when entering pitlane line. also if entered pitlane entrance, cannot exit it (remove boxbox call then?)
- [t] illegal or unactive drafting move shoulnd't preview car
- [t] push not working (maybe nose was outside? check SAT error value) -> adjust error for all attackmvos collisions
- [t] rotation inside box
- [t] no attack moves after box
- [t] drafting can't happen if there's a car colliding with the drafting meter
- [t] fix drafting meter collision (not nose only) // cannot simply consider car (as that would let some illegal move happen (nose further than move))
- [t] preclick on gear selection
- [t] skip boost when not available
- translation tire tokens or tire points
- player can cross finish line diagonally (cannot check for direction after without preventing rotation after)
- gear vector not being destroyed after animation end (happens only if browser is not active)
- brake car flickering
- dropshadow make safari crash?
- how to handle 1st 2nd 3rd Xth cases

POSSIBLE CODE RESTRUCT:
- could move offtrack check and other position validity checks on action handler. position will seem valid in UI but server will throw exception.
  this makes arg method simpler and also UI less confusing on why certain position are not valid. only blocked position will be those colliding and those denied by shunk
- unified skip action?
- car pos legal checks overhaul(?)
- token selection auto fill redo(?)

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- wider first positioning area
- add background
- can't reenter track after calling boxbox and entering pitlane -> restructure car pos exceptions
- circuit layout combinations for different laps -> highlight track layout on bottom left of map for each player 
- tournament based on thinking time
- volountary penality?
- endgame race replay
- icons in log
- scroll map to new events option
- emergency brake visuals that show each invalid vector
