CURRENT TODO:
- tooltips -> all concerned elements should have ids!!
- pit stop

GAMEPLAY DEVELOPMENT:
- pit stop
- new curves and offtrack detection system

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- tournament based on thinking time
- volontary penality

GENERAL:
- some comments around the code would be nice
- some elements could be kept active on user input, server will handle move validity. maybe better for user understanding

CORRECTIONS:
- adjust engage maneuver delay to new hide-noAttMovAvail version

BUGS:
- gear vector not being destroyed after animation end (happens only if browser is not active)
- brake car flickering
- attack maneuvers not working sometimes?

BONUS STUFF:
- icons in log
- current gear display on hover car (dicelike)
- endgame race replay
- wider first positioning area
- emergency brake visuals that show each invalid vector
- could make selection octagons interactable with server error mesages (just hide previews for unactive players)

GAME INTERFACE:
- be sure that interface is robust to page zoom
- add touch controls for hovering events
- tooltips everywhere

GAME LOGIC:
- many clienttranslate missing
- give extra time to players

GAME DATA, STATISTICS AND OPTION:
- statistics
- scroll to new events option
