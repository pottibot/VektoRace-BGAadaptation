CURRENT TODO (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE):
- race order of completion
- pit stop:
  - [t] boxbox checks
  - [t] place car enter box
  - [t] deny lap entrance when boxbox
  - [t] deny box entrance from boost
  - [t] deny box entrance from attack
  - [t] handle exception on action
  - [t] box oveshoot anim
  - [t] prevent box at first turn and last lap
  - [t] prevent boxbox promt after first time
  - [t] handle case of when player steps in box with more than 4tokens each 
  - [t] attack movs at pitstop exit?
  - [t] remove boxbox after box
- fix new turn order anim timer (make it dynamic to player num);
- new offtrack detection system
- tooltips -> all concerned elements should have ids!!
- car pos legal checks overhaul(?)
- token selection auto fill redo(?)
- solve mf car placement exception handler

GAMEPLAY DEVELOPMENT:
- [t] pit stop
- new curves and offtrack detection system

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- tournament based on thinking time
- volontary penality

GENERAL:
- some comments around the code would be nice
- some elements could be kept active on user input, server will handle move validity. maybe better for user understanding

CORRECTIONS:
- adjust engage maneuver delay to new hide-noAttMovAvail version
- add map limit
- could move offtrack check and other position validity checks on action handler. position will seem valid in UI but server will throw exception.
  this makes arg method simpler and also UI less confusing on why certain position are not valid. only blocked position will be those colliding and those denied by shunk
- skip attack maneuver for first player
- player can cross finish line diagonally (cannot check for direction after without preventing rotation after)

BUGS:
- gear vector not being destroyed after animation end (happens only if browser is not active)
- brake car flickering
- attack maneuvers not working sometimes?
- broke attack maneuvers?
- broke turn order?

BONUS STUFF:
- icons in log
- current gear display on hover car (dicelike)
- endgame race replay
- wider first positioning area
- emergency brake visuals that show each invalid vector
- could make selection octagons interactable with server error mesages (just hide previews for unactive players)
- unified skip action
- 

GAME INTERFACE:
- be sure that interface is robust to page zoom
- add touch controls for hovering events
- tooltips everywhere
- dropshadow make safari crash?
- add visual reminders of penalities 
- test browsers

GAME LOGIC:
- many clienttranslate missing
- give extra time to players
- clean pitwall use
- OOP pw and curves (VektoraceCurve extend VektoraceOctagon, ...)

GAME DATA, STATISTICS AND OPTION:
- statistics
- scroll to new events option
