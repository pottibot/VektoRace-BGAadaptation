GAMEPLAY DEVELOPMENT:
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- invalid future move prediction (boost/gear that can't generate valid positions, use of boost if no boost positions are valid, choice of gear if only valid car placement is a black move and player has no tire tokens)
- emergency break
=======
- [TEST] invalid future move prediction (boost/gear that can't generate valid positions, use of boost if no boost positions are valid, choice of gear if only valid car placement is a black move and player has no tire tokens)
- [TEST] emergency break
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- nitro/tire gear shift
- attack maneuvers
- pit stop

GENERAL:
- some comments around the code would be nice

BUGS:
- negative orientations are not handled well and should be avoided when updating the DB
- close calls with behind() not always right
- collision algorithm detects collision with adjacent octagons
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
- PITWALL IS ACTUALLY SMALLER THAN A VECTOR?? (3/4 of it, to be precise) fixing this will be boring and may brake some stuff
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

BONUS STUFF:
- add flying start octagon preview (+ animation)
- game elements (clip-path) shadows
- track map
- html tokens in notification log
- current gear display on hover car (dicelike)

GAME INTERFACE:
- adjust scroll to interface scaling
- be sure that interface is robust to page zoom
- add touch controls for hovering events

GAME LOGIC:
- clienttranslate exception messages
- give extra time to players
- game progression
