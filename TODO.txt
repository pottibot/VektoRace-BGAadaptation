GAMEPLAY DEVELOPMENT:
- [TEST] invalid future move prediction (boost/gear that can't generate valid positions, use of boost if no boost positions are valid, choice of gear if only valid car placement is a black move and player has no tire tokens)
- [TEST] emergency break
- [TEST] nitro/tire gear shift
- [INTERFACE VISUALIZATION MISSING] attack maneuvers
    . drafting (no tire token used, min 3rd gear for both cars, same dir as enemy car, max 2 octagon distance from enemy car bottom)
    . slingshot pass (same as above, but only 1 oct max distance)
    . pushing (same as above)
    . shunting (min 2nd gear for player car only, same dir as enemy car, max 1 oct distance from enemey car bottom sides)
- pit stop
- game progression

GENERAL:
- some comments around the code would be nice

BUGS:
- negative orientations are not handled well and should be avoided when updating the DB
- close calls with behind() not always right
- collision algorithm detects collision with adjacent octagons
- PITWALL IS ACTUALLY SMALLER THAN A VECTOR?? (3/4 of it, to be precise) fixing this will be boring and may brake some stuff

BONUS STUFF:
- add flying start octagon preview (+ animation)
- game elements (clip-path) shadows
- track map
- icons in log
- current gear display on hover car (dicelike)
- endgame replay

GAME INTERFACE:
- adjust scroll to interface scaling
- be sure that interface is robust to page zoom
- add touch controls for hovering events

GAME LOGIC:
- many clienttranslate missing
- give extra time to players

GAME DATA, STATISTICS AND OPTION:
- map variants
- statistics
- scroll to new events option
