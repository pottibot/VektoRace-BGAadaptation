VEKTORACE INTERFACE CODE CLEANUP SERVICE:
- get rid of dojo (KINDA)
- Rotation as a css Class (MHH)
- OnEnteringState calling func
- create all game elements statically (???)

GAMEPLAY PLEASE PROGRESS:
- use of boost during movement phase
- player board elements (nitro and tire tokens)
- current gear display (dicelike)
- illegal placement detection (maybe display illegal moves with red X)

---------------------------------------------------
!! STUFF:
- sends each step of movement phase to server (otherwise i could reset movement by refreshing page)
  ALSO BECAUSE ALL POSSIBLE MOVEMENTS ARE GIVEN TO CLIENT WHICH CAN LEAD TO CHEATING (DISPLAY ALL POSISITIONS SO THAT I KNOW IN ADVANCE WHICH IS THE BEST VECTOR POSITION)

  V
SOLUTION:
- keep unistate movement phase
- sends each step to server, which responds only to active player (or let others ignore notifications) with newly available positions
- if page is reloaded OnEnteringState: playerMovement catch exact step using a switch on some state arg, and renders scene accordingly
- rest works as before
---------------------------------------------------

CSSEX:
- clean sprite positioning by adding 1 px to every movement (es: 0-500, 501-1000, ...)

SCARY STUFF:
- attack maneuvers
- pit stop

BORING STUFF:
- statistics
- game progression

BEAUTY SALOON:
- game elements (clip-path) shadows
- track map
