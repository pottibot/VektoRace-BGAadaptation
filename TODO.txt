ASK JURICA:
- tutorial issues (attach tutorial window to selOct, open dialog win)
- set preferences based on if first game or not
- 

BUG and FIXES:
- [v] boost lets cut curves  (no offtrack detection for car position) https://boardgamearena.com/bug?id=64356
- [v] interface prechecks for boost when confirm on
- [v] illegal vector pos should display denied pos before no valid pos invalid
- [v] game progression based on first player instead
- [v] wrong player order after slingshot maneuver https://boardgamearena.com/table?table=263872811 weeeird behaviour of new turn order at move #497 (see moves before too, like slingshot at #492). probably curve progression system failed. reason for later emergency brake due to invisible wall (FUCK)
  > ok, what happened is:
    player didn't complete curve before, went too far next curve (thought i had fixed this)
- [v] triangle plane slightly off? (left side)
- [v] check last move overtake and finish race results in tie (check victory points assignment)
- [v] boost confirmation will always results in first select boost to be selected
- [v] entering box at an angle without tire tokens available, game stuck
- [v] with confirm option on, player is able to click on other sel octagons (server then blocks call but aint pretty) 
- [v] stop mouse wheel on interactable elements
- firefox cutting sprites not pretty

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- [v] add statistic initial positition
- [v] leave game when race is finished / forfeit if too far behind
- new indianottolis map
- new rulez:
  - remove token refill limit
  - shunt can be performed diagonally too
  - sorpasso boost (6 octagons allow free slingshot pass)
  - overshooting pit stop now only give a -2 refilled token penality
- random start line pos
- circuit layout combinations for different laps -> highlight track layout on bottom left of map for each player
- choose initial pos
- game metadata manager (new banner title image for home screen?)
- add tooltip to various selection octagon
- add vector preview to inactive player too (maybe as a preference)
- change cursor for moves not allowed
- separate invalid pos with unavailable positions
- better notification for no attack reason
- more and better tooltips
- add statistics resources left
- tournament scoring system

POSSIBLE CODE RESTRUCT:
- curve system remake -> delete offtrack detection by curve zone and make curve progress based on curve distance to car (safer?)
- (???) could move offtrack check and other position validity checks on action handler. position will seem valid in UI but server will throw exception.
  this makes arg method simpler and also UI less confusing on why certain position are not valid. only blocked position will be those colliding and those denied by shunk
- everything :P
